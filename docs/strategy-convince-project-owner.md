How to convince project owner
=============================

It is always hard to persuade project owner or project holder tp start project migration from one framework to another.
From the business perspective this is high resource consuming task, which does not provide any immediate outcome: application
will not receive any new features and thus will not earn eny more money.

There is no universal way to convince project owner that framework migration is necessary. However, there are some arguments,
which may help you:

* In case project based on outdated technology, it might be hard to add some modern feature to it. World does not stand
  still some new features and trends may appear any time and business may want to utilize them. Having up-to-date modern
  framework ensures this will be easy.

* Using more powerful framework will reduce the time needed for new feature implementation, which will save money for
  the business in long term.

* Using of outdated technology for too long may cause project to be impossible to run on modern computers. Operation systems,
  utilities and PHP itself continue to evolve sometimes causing backward compatibility break changes. Without an update
  it is just the matter of time when the project will be unable to function on modern systems. For example: PHP frameworks
  written 8-10 years ago are unable to function with PHP 7, which was a breakthrough in terms of performance.

* It is always hard to hire new people to development team working with old technology. People do not study frameworks,
  which are almost out of use - they study ones, which are modern and in high demand. Migration to the new technology
  ensures development team can be expanded, if necessary, and people leaving the team are replaceable.

* Having cutting-edge technology as a background of the project will inspire development team. It will make developers
  more happy, positive and certain for their future. This will bring positive impact on the development team performance
  and reduce the risk some people may leave it. 

Note that no matter what you do, even at best situation, you will unlikely receive more then 2 weeks from the business
for the project migration task.

It may also happen you will be unable to persuade project owner. In this case consider to start project migration on your own.
After all, you are the one, who will benefit from the result. It may make sense for you to spend extra time for the process
to save more in the future.

If you started the project migration, and project owner ask you to implement new feature, you should always answer with
something like this: "Normally this would take X days, but since we using new framework now it cost us just X-Y days".
Such tactics will simplify further negotiations about finalizing migration process for you.
